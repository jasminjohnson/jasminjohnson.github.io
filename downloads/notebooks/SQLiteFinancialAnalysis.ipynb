    "relational database management system, or RDBMS. Relational database systems are\n",
    "used to store user-defined records in large tables. In addition to data storage and management, a database engine can process complex query commands that combine data\n",
    "from multiple tables to generate reports and data summaries.\n",
    "The “Lite” in SQLite does not refer to its capabilities. Rather, SQLite is lightweight\n",

    "It is for users and developers wanting to create, search, and edit databases. It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface,\n",
