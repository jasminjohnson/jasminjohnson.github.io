    "## What is SQLite?\n",
    "\n",
    "from book \"Using SQLite by Jay A. Kreibich\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What is SQLite: In the simplest terms, SQLite is a public-domain software package that provides a\n",
    "relational database management system, or RDBMS. Relational database systems are\n",
    "used to store user-defined records in large tables. In addition to data storage and management, a database engine can process complex query commands that combine data\n",
    "from multiple tables to generate reports and data summaries. Other popular RDBMS\n",
    "products include Oracle Database, IBM’s DB2, and Microsoft’s SQL Server on the\n",
    "commercial side, with MySQL and PostgreSQL being popular open source products.\n",
    "The “Lite” in SQLite does not refer to its capabilities. Rather, SQLite is lightweight\n",
    "when it comes to setup complexity, administrative overhead, and resource usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DB Brower for SQLite?\n",
    "DB Browser for SQLite is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for users and developers wanting to create databases, search, and edit data. It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface,\n",
    "and you don't need to learn complicated SQL commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLite data types\n",
    "All data types that are supported by SQLite 3:\n",
    "INTEGER: A signed integer up to 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.\n",
    "REAL: An 8-byte floating point value.\n",
    "TEXT: A text string, typically UTF-8 encoded (depending on the database encoding).\n",
    "BLOB: A blob of data (binary large object) for storing binary data.\n",
    "NULL: A NULL value, represents missing data or an empty cell.\n",
    "No designated Boolean data type: simply re-purpose the INTEGER type to represent Boolean values (0 = false, 1 = true).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use SQLite to read Excel File?\n",
